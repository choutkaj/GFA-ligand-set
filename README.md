# GFA-ligand-set

This repository contains the Galectin Fluorescence Anisotropy ligand set. This set comprises 1022 unique ligands with known Kd values against Galectin-1 and -3 collected from literature and patents. All the Kd values were measured by a single assay - fluorescence anisotropy (fluorescence polarization) assay. The set is categorized into several subsets based on structure and binding mode. Basic physicochemical properties are provided. The repository also contains docked structures in Galectin-3 (5H9P) as well as structures optimized with frozen protein at various levels of theory.

The GFA ligand set was published in the following paper:


The GFA ligand set is also available at Zenodo:
